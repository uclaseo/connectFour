## Two Versions
### ConnectFour Instrcuted Version
This version follows the instruction, and appropriate functions are implemented.  To run the tests, execute the following in the terminal.

```
npm test
```

### ConnectFour My Own Version
This version is my own implementation.  Using input stream, a player is asked to input a column to place a disc, and keeps rotating players between 'r' and 'y'.  Everytime input is executed, the updated board is printed out to show status.  The codes to run this at the bottom is commented out, so to run this, uncomment lines 424 and 425.
```
// uncomment
// const connectFour = new ConnectFour();
// connectFour.startNewGame();
```
Then, run the script
```
npm start
```
